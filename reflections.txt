What new skills have you learned?

I am a little more advanced so I didn’t learn a lot of new stuff, although I didn’t know who to use <sup>, and it was nice getting a little refresher in some of basic html elements

What has been easy?

It was pretty easy for me, but that’s because I already have some experience with html

What has been difficult?

I found the most difficult thing was just making sure that I didn’t put the formatting in certain places I didn’t mean to place it.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

If I forget a particular html tag, I just google it.
